[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

Enhance Netgear integration for Home Assistant which adds sensors and switches for certain Netgear routers.

_based on previous work by [roblandry](https://github.com/roblandry/netgear-enhanced-integration) and [selfish](https://github.com/selfish/home-assistant-netgear-router-enhanced-integration)._

### Router model support:

_These are router which were tested and are known to work, add yours!_

- XR500 (port 80)
- R7000 (port 80)

For models which use port 80, see [Setup](#setup) below.

## Setup

_Note that you will need to restart Home Assistant after installion, whichever method is used._

### Option 1 - HACS (recommended!):

1. In HACS, go to Integrations, and then click the orange '+' button in the lower right corner to add an integration.
1. Search for "Netgear Enhanced" and install it.

### Option 2 - Manual:

1. Create a directory named `netgear_enhanced` under `custom_components`.
1. Copy the files from to the `netgear_enhanced` folder in this repository.

## Configurations:

- Use the following examples in your configuration file (typically `configuration.yaml`). Note that you may need to merge `switch` and `sensor` keys with existing ones.
- Make sure to modify the parameters to fit your needs. It's recommended to use secrets for all sensitive info.
- After making changes there may be some delay before entities are updated due to the router changing configuration.
- Different routers use different ports for authentication. If you know your router port is different from 5000, specify that, otherwise, ususally 5000 or 80 will work.
- Each configuration key is either required, or is not required because it uses a default value, which is mentioned below

### Default values:

| Config Value | Explanation | Required? (Default) |
|---|---|---|
| username | Router access username | Yes |
| password | Router access password | Yes |
| host | Router access URL/IP | No (Default: 192.168.1.1) |
| port | Router access port. This is typically 5000 or 80. | No (Default: 5000) |
| ssl | Should the integration access the router using SSL? (true/false) | No (Default: false) | 
| prefix | Entities created by the integration will use this as a prefix for their id | No (Default: ng_enhanced) |
| scan_interval | Interval between updates polling from the router | No (Default: 5 minutes) |
| resources | List of resources to use in Home Assistant. See examples below for full lists of available resources | Yes |   

### Actions / Switches:
